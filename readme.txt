Simple social plugin that loads popular social sharing widgets asynchronously
after the page loads for optimal site performance.

== Description ==

Simple social sharing plugin that loads the third-party scripts asynchronously
and after the page loads to improve site performance.

The plugin provides settings to load any of the following sharing widgets:

*	Twitter
*	Facebook
*	Google+
*	Linkedin
*	Hacker News

Available display options include ability to display the sharing widgets on
above or below content on pages, specific custom post types or blog and archive pages.


Why is Asynchronous script loading better?
Asynchronous loading allows multiple files to load parallel to each other.
Instead of having to wait for Twitter to respond with their script, the browser
moves on and starts fetching the next request.

Dependencies

*	WordPress 3.5+
*	Content worth sharing
